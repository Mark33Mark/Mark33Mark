- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mark33Mark
- 👀 I’m interested in tinkering with bits and bytes.  Expanded into IOT, Arduino, and successfully made a wifi air quality monitor with a TFT touchscreen powered by a LIPO battery that uploads sensor readings to a mySQL database that is then hosted on my website.
- 🌱 Currently studying a coding course with University of Sydney.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things digital.
- 📫 I'm contactable: mark@watsonised.com
